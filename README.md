## üè´ About the Project
Barf Yar is a collaborative project developed by students of the **Computer Engineering Department at Bu-Ali Sina University (BASU)**, under the guidance of the **BASU Computer Engineering Student Association**.  

This system was designed to solve a real need for **Barf-No(ÿ®ÿ±ŸÅ ŸÜŸà)** charity: managing activities, collaborators, and targeted reminders in an efficient and scalable way.  

By combining a modern **admin panel** (Go + PostgreSQL) with a dynamic **Telegram bot**, the project empowers charity administrators to:  
- Coordinate events and activities more effectively  
- Engage volunteers through Telegram with minimal effort  
- Organize supporters using dynamic labels and broadcast reminders at the right time  

This project demonstrates the ability of BASU students to deliver impactful, community-driven solutions that blend **computer science education** with **real-world social responsibility**.
